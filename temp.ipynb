      "The ocean produces more oxygen than trees because it is much larger and contains more phytoplankton, which are the main producers of oxygen in the ocean. Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that live in the upper layers of the ocean and use sunlight to photosynthesize, producing oxygen as a byproduct. Trees also produce oxygen through photosynthesis, but they are much smaller than the ocean and cover a much smaller area. In fact, the entire area of the ocean is about 145 million square kilometers, while the total area of forests is only about 4 billion hectares. This means that the ocean produces about 50 times more oxygen than forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to being larger, the ocean also contains more phytoplankton than forests. Phytoplankton are found in all parts of the ocean, from the surface to the depths, while trees are only found on land. This means that the ocean has a much greater capacity to produce oxygen than forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ocean is also a more efficient producer of oxygen than forests. Phytoplankton are able to use sunlight more efficiently than trees, and they can also produce oxygen at a faster rate. This is because phytoplankton have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio than trees, which means that they can absorb more sunlight and produce more oxygen per unit of biomass.\n",
      "\n",
